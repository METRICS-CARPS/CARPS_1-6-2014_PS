For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Study 1 in section "Laptop versus longhand performance".

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Laptop versus longhand performance. Mixed fixed and
random-effects analyses of variance were used to
test differences, with note-taking medium (laptop vs.
longhand) as a fixed effect and lecture (which talk was
viewed) as a random effect. We converted the raw data
to z scores because the lecture assessments varied in difficulty
and number of points available; however, results
did not differ when raw scores were analyzed.4 On factual-
recall questions, participants performed equally well
across conditions (laptop: M = 0.021, SD = 1.31; longhand:
M = 0.009, SD = 1.02), F(1, 55) = 0.014, p = .91.
However, on conceptual-application questions, laptop
participants performed significantly worse (M = −0.156,
SD = 0.915) than longhand participants (M = 0.154, SD =
1.08), F(1, 55) = 9.99, p = .03, ηp2 = .13 (see Fig. 1).5
Which lecture participants saw also affected performance
on conceptual-application questions, F(4, 55) = 12.52,
p = .02, ηp2 = .16; however, there was no significant
interaction between lecture and note-taking medium,
F(4, 55) = 0.164, p = .96.
